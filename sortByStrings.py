# Question 1 -- sortByStrings(s,t): Sort the letters in the string s by the order they occur 
# in the string t. You can assume t will not have repetitive characters. For s = "weather" 
# and t = "therapyw", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "theeraw". For s = "good" 
# and t = "odg", the output should be sortByString(s, t) = "oodg".
